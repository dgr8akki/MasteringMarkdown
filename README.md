# Mastering Markdown

This is a repo with a single file i.e. this file(Readme.md). This repo primary aims at learning markdown by practise. The tutorial which I am following in learning markdown is [Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/).

## Module 1: Paragraph and Text decorations

### Bold, italics and strike through(* or _ for italics, ** or __ for bold, ~~ for strike through, around the word)

Aakash is **great**.
Hello *world*.

Aakash is simply __awesome__.
Hello *world*, It's _Aakash_.
Aakash is ~~not~~ good.
