# Mastering Markdown

This is a repo with a single file i.e. this file(Readme.md). This repo primary aims at learning markdown by practise. The tutorial which I am following in learning markdown is [Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/).

## Module 1: Paragraph and Text decorations

### Bold, italics and strike through(* or _ for italics, ** or __ for bold, ~~ for strike through, around the word)

Aakash is **great**.

Hello *world*.

Aakash is simply __awesome__.

Hello *world*, It's _Aakash_.

Aakash is ~~not~~ good.

## Module 2: Headings

# h1 (# = h1)

## h2 (## = h2)

### h3 (### = h3)

##### h4 (#### = h4)

###### h5 (##### = h5)

## Module 3: Links in markdown

### Simple links

#### Add angle <> braces around any link to make it clickable link

e.g. <https://dgr8akki.github.io>

#### Use this format for links [text](link, title) (Try hover on below link)

e.g. [Aakash Pahuja](https://dgr8akki.github.io, "Portfolio | Aakash Pahuja")

#### Use references with this format [text][reference name]

e.g. [Aakash Pahuja][Aakash]

[Aakash]: https://dgr8akki.github.io
